## Part Two: Researching Commands (Find)

The `find` command is a useful command that allows one to recursively search for files and directories within a given directory.

In this section, we will go over some interesting command line options that can be used to refine a search.

All information for this section was found here: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/].

### Option 1: `find -type`

```bash
find grep lol
```

### Option 2: `find -name`

### Option 3: `find -size`

### Option 4: `find -exec`

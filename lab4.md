# Lab Report 4: Vim
__________

In this lab, we clone a buggy program from an online GitHub repository, debug the program, and push the changes back to GitHub - all through the command line!

## Logging into ieng6:

Keys Pressed: '<up><ENTER>'

The command to log into ieng6 through ssh is:
'ssh ashapow@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu'

However, because the Bash terminal conveniently saves the most recent commands that were typed, and because the last thing I did on my device's terminal was log into ieng6, I simply had to press '<up>' to access the full command.

From here, we can log in.

In order to fix the bug, the incremented variable in Line 44 needs to be changed from index1 to index2. 


## Part 2 - Reflection

One of the most important technical skills I learned throughout the latter half of the quarter was how to properly use vim. I had a small amount of exposure to vim through a previous course, and all that stayed with me was how cumbersome it was to use. Now, however, as I am beginning to grow comfortable with it, I've started to appreciate all of the commands available at the literal press of a buttom. I've even started to use Vim Shortcuts from whithin IDEs in order to work on assignments for other classes. 

Something concrete that I learned from the labs during the second half of the quarter was how to set up SSH keys from GitHub. I have spent more time than I'd like to admit failing to properly set up remotes within Git repositories, and yet until this class I did not see why SSH would be any easier than the standard HTTPS clone. Now, I can say that cloning from SSH has been monumental for me. I cannot stress enough how grateful I am for learning how to this, regardless of how simple it may be.

Finally, I learned a great deal from tutors and TAs regarding how to navigate Computer Science as an undergrad. I learned how to effectively get in touch with faculty, how to get started reading papers in CS, and how to find a passion project. As a transfer student with only a few more quarters left at UCSD, I feel much more confident in my ability to move forwards and succeed in the time I have left.
